# Religion mod - Stellaris

This mod is about adding detailed representations of fictional religions to improve the social/event perspective of the game. This readme is a sort of roadmap as to where we need to go.

## Definitions

The mod introduces different religions which will affect pops and their attitude to certain events.

**List of possible religions:**
- Atheists
- ...

The mod will also introduce secondary quests (special buildings to build, sacred wars towards enemy religions)

Religions should have multiple ethics: one could be aggressive and dominative, another could advertise pacifism and open-mindedness.

## Todo

#### Social

##### Traits

##### Government
A Religion and the Government type should be tied together. For example, a *Democracy* government will induce to the pops a more "free thinking" and less cohesive pops (a mix of atheists and something else), that could be defined through custom events, or a general percentage.

*Proposition*:
- Democracy: pops are "free" and do what they think. They should be able to choose their religion of choice, or not to believe in any. Minor religious presence within pops could make these concerned populations happier, with a steady decrease in happiness in case of no positive events.
- Oligarchy: pops are more-or-less obliged to follow one religion, although some minor religions are tolerated. If a minor religion wants to become the main religion, either some "holy wars" events could occur, a sequence of events (riots, uprisings, wild conversions or propaganda...) or a tragic consequence (lost war, a sacred planet destroyed/recaptured...)
- Dictatorship: pops are obliged to follow the official religion, minor religions will be prosecuted and exterminated upon the player's choice.
- Monarchy: similar to dictatorship
- Hive Mind: no religions.

##### Civics
